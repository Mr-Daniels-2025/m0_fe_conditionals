# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
* I am feeling more confident after going through each lesson in detail. I still need to build understanding through repetition (i.e., proficiency).

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
* Please see previous answer. I am not a fast pace, yet.  But I am 1000% better today than I was yesterday.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
* I am confident now that I have gone through the lesson and paired with a classmate. I've made a few mistakes on this lesson during my first attempts...but understand what I did wrong.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
* I spent a few hours on this lesson to understand it and build better proficiency. It exceeded my estimation...but was value-added in reflecting, asking questions, researching and pairing.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
* I need to practice the For Statements exercise and have set time do that with Jedeo on Thursday at 09:30AM.

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
* I need to review the == and === and !== and other symbols and terminology.  I am still a bit slow (and have to slow down and read then re-read those to understand exactly what they mean).
